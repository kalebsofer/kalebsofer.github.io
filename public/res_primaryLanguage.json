      "description": "Hi, I'm Kaleb. I design and build data infrastructure, from storage and pipelines to visualizations and data-driven decision making.\nMy experience spans both private and public sectors, each presenting unique challenges and tools. Recently, I collaborated with the Ministry of Justice on a large-scale data migration, transitioning critical outsourced systems to an in-house, accessible AWS environment.\nPreviously, I developed machine learning techniques for pattern detection in anti-money laundering investigations within the banking sector. Prior to that, I worked on the rapid scaling of a payments system for Deliveroo.\n In addition to my contracting work, I'm building a company called Burst. Learn more about us here.",
